<h2>Why support a local sports store?</h2>

<p>Josie and I had collabrated on this idea when we were in our undergraduate career at Simpson College. The idea came to us due to the fact that Indianola was lacking in the sports environment. If someone were to want to buy cleats, pads, bats, or anything related to gear, they would have to drive up to Des Moines. By opening up our own local sports store with all the gear someone could want, it provides athletes here at Simpson College ways to buy them. Why buy gear online, where you don't know how well it will fit, when you could just come in and try anything on? We would also like to mention that all Simpson athletes have a 15% discount on anything in the store. Doing this allows us to hold our long and healthy relationship with Simpson College.</p>

<p>Looking at the tables below, you can see our competitive prices with other sports-related stores and can see that we beat their prices by a long shot. Not only does this promote healthy business, but also by supporting local business, you allow competition to prosper and create more jobs and wages for the town of Indianola. For the month of September, for every $100 you spend Kosta's and Josie's Local Sports Store will donate $50 to Red Cross for Hurricane Irma relief.</p>
